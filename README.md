# ES6 Features with Babel

Small project which helps you to start shaping up with ECMAScript 6 using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) compiler. The bunch of **code samples** which are shipped with Karma and Jasmine to do **unit testing** and learn new stuff quickly.

The code partly comes from [Traceur's wiki] (https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures) and [lukehoban/es6features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) which I recommend to watch. Some descriptions might come from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org). It's also worth looking out [ECMAScriptcompatibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/). Every other piece of code which isn't mine has a source mentioned in comment
above the code.

Looking for minimal version? Check out this [gist](https://gist.github.com/MichalZalecki/e740c05ddf9e626c6394)!

## How to start

Install npm dependencies abd run ``grunt`` to compile ES6 to ES5 and run tests.
